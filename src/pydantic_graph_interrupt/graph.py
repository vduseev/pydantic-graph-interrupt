    """The result of resuming an interruptible graph.

    This is a subclass of `GraphRunResult` that adds a `interrupt_node`
    attribute. When the graph finishes its run and reaches an `End` node,
    the outcome is the same as a normal `GraphRunResult`.

    When the graph is interrupted by a `InterruptNode`, the outcome is slightly
    different. The `output` attribute is empty and the `interrupt_node` attribute
    is set to the `InterruptNode` that interrupted the execution.

    The returned `InterruptNode` is the next node to be executed when resuming
    the graph. Its `run` method has not been called yet.

    The `interrupt_node` and the `state` can be modified and passed back to
    the `resume` method and will overwrite the values in the persistence
    in that case.

    Attributes:
        state: The state of the graph at the end of the resume attempt.
        interrupt_node: The `InterruptNode` that interrupted the execution or
        ``None`` if the graph has finished its run.
        persistence: The persistence implementation that was used for
        this graph run.
        output: The data returned by the :pyclass:`End` node if the graph
        has finished its run.
        is_interrupted: Whether the graph was interrupted by a `InterruptNode`.
        is_finished: Whether the graph finished its run.
